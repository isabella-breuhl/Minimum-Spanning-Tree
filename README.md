# Minimum-Spanning-Tree
Java application designed to compute the minimum spanning tree for a given set of locations. The purpose of this application is to assist a city in the optimal placement of routers for a WiFi network, ensuring the routers are connected in the most cost-efficient manner. 

The program reads input from a text file. Using this data, it minimizes the total length of the cables needed to connect all routers in the cheapest way. The program outputs an SVG file that visually represents the optimal network configuration. Example output shown below...
